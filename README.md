# Object-Detection-System
Detecting obejcts and machine parts made easy by implementing an Object Detection System that trains on sample data provided to it.
• Built an object detection system by fine-tuning YOLOv8 on a custom dataset, enabling automated component
detection and improving quality control and production efficiency.
• Built a user-friendly GUI to allow unskilled workers to interact with the system in real time
• Successfully deployed and currently in use at Siemens factory in Goa, helping streamline quality control and
reduce manual inspection
